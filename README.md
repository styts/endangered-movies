Endangered Movies
=================

Motivation
----------
* see which movies are well-seeded and which need more seeding
* see what torrents correspond to what imdb movie title
* see which movies are available in _720p_ and _1080p_ resolutions
* find out if there is a linear correlation between movie popularity and number of seeders
* produce a table that displays all of the above columns:
    * movie title
    * imdb popularity (number of votes)
    * imdb rating
    * _seededness_ (number of seeds for the highest-seeded torrent)
    * status (endangered[seeds < 5] or healthy)
